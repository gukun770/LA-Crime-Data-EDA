# LA-Crime-Data-EDA
Crime Data EDA for Saturday's Data Science EDA meetup

For this Saturday (June 9, 2018), we (Data Science Fellows at Galvanize SF) be looking at LA's Crime Data for exploratory data analysis (https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-Present/y8tr-7khq). The mission is to come up with real and strategic policy recommendations that would best benefit the LA Police, the local government, and other principal stakeholders.
